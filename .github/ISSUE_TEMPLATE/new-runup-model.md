**Who is the published the model and in what year?**
e.g. Stockdon et al. (2006)

**Please provide a link, doi or citation to the paper**
e.g. Stockdon, H.F., Holman, R.A., Howd, P.A., Sallenger, A.H., 2006. Empirical parameterization of setup, swash, and runup. Coastal Engineering 53, 573â€“588. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2005.12.005

**If possible, please provide the relevant equation references**
For example:
  - Eqn 18: R2 for dissipative beaches
  - Eqn 19: R2 for intermediate and reflective beaches
  - Eqn 10: Wave setup
  - Eqn 11: Incident swash
  - Eqn 12: Infragravity swash
  - Eqn 7: Total swash

**Any other details that would be useful?**
For example:
  - Did the authors use different wave height? (i.e. not reverse-shoaled deep water significant wave height?)
  - Are there variables other than Hs, Tp and beta which are used?
