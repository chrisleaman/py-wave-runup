Installation
------------

Installation of ``py-wave-runup`` can be done with uv or pip:

.. code:: bash

    # Using uv (recommended)
    uv add py-wave-runup

    # Using pip
    pip install py-wave-runup


Usage
-----

The following `wave runup models`_ are available for use:

- ``models.Stockdon2006``: The most commonly cited and widely used runup model.
- ``models.Power2018``: Based on the Gene-Expression Programming technique.
- ``models.Holman1986``: Incorporated wave setup using Duck, NC measurements.
- ``models.Nielsen2009``: Based on runup measurements from NSW, Australia.
- ``models.Ruggiero2001``: Based on runup measurements from dissipative Orgeon beaches.
- ``models.Vousdoukas2012``: Based on runup from European Atlantic coast
- ``models.Senechal2011``: Based on extreme storm condition at Truc Vert, France
- ``models.Beuzen2019``: Gaussian Process (GP) runup model
- ``models.Passarella2018``: Genetic Programming (infragravity and total) swash model 

To get calculate runup, setup and swash, define your offshore conditions in your
selected runup model then you can access each parameter:

.. code:: python

    from py_wave_runup import models

    model_sto06 = models.Stockdon2006(Hs=4, Tp=12, beta=0.1)

    model_sto06.R2     # 2.54
    model_sto06.setup  # 0.96
    model_sto06.sinc   # 2.06
    model_sto06.sig    # 1.65

Background
----------

Wave runup refers to the final part of a wave's journey as it travels from offshore
onto the beach. It is observable by anyone who goes to the beach and watches the edge
of the water "runup" and rundown the beach. It is comprised of two components:

    - **setup**: the height of the time averaged superelevation of the mean water level
      above the Still Water Level (SWL)
    - **swash**: the height of the time varying fluctuation of the instantaneous water
      level about the setup elevation

Setup, swash and other components of Total Water Level (TWL) rise are shown in this
handy figure below.

Wave runup can contribute a significant portion of the increase in TWL in coastal
storms causing erosion and inundation. For example, Stockdon et al. (2006) [#sto06]_
collated data from numerous experiments, some of which showed wave runup 2% excedence
heights in excess of 3 m during some storms.

Given the impact such a large increase in TWL can have on coastlines, there has been
much research conducted to try improve our understanding of wave runup processes.
Although there are many processes which can influence wave runup (such as nonlinear
wave transformation, wave reflection, three-dimensional effects, porosity, roughness,
permeability and groundwater) [#cem06]_, many attempts have been made to derive
empirical relatinoships based on easily measurable parameters. Typically, empirical
wave runup models include:

    - **Hs**: significant wave height
    - **Tp**: peak wave length
    - **beta**: beach slope

This python package attempts to consolidate the work done by others in this field and
collate the numerous empirical relationships for wave runup which have been published.

Contributing
------------

As there are many different empirical wave models out there, contributions are most
welcome. If you don't feel confident about changing the code yourself, feel free to open
a `Github issue`_ and let us know what could be added. Otherwise, follow the steps below
to create a Pull Request:
